# Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab. It aims to detect malicious activity in network traffic through supervised learning models. The approach includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
